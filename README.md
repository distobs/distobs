# hi

My name is Guilherme. I'm a young developer from Ceará, Brazil, currently studying Informatics in an integrated course at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará (IFCE), on the Fortaleza campus.

My interests include low-level programming (C, C++, ASM), web development - especially back-end development -, and competitive programming.

My knowledge base includes C, C++, Python. For the web, specifically, I enjoy working with Flask. I'm currently looking towards deepening the knowledge I already have and discovering new, shiny places.

I also have a knack for music, philosophy, literature, poetry, linguistics, swimming and living in general.
